# CET-2
This is a repository for all the programs done in 3-2

## Why the new repository?
The old one was pretty badly organized and I thought I'll make a better repo with this one and also brush off my dusty Git skills along the way. So, here we are!

### [Day-1](/Day-1/)
On this day, we did Linear and Binary search algorithms and a few nice problems along the way

### [Day-2](/Day-2/)
We did the linear and binary but, we also learnt Jump, Exponential and Ternary search algos as well

### [Day-3](/Day-3/)
We did all the basic sorting algorithms like bubble, insertion, selection, quick and merge

### Day - 4
We did sorting again with an intro to Linked Lists

### [Day-5](/Day-5/)
Competitive programming - 101 with a few problems from CodeForces and brushed up on Linked lists (singular, doubly and circular).

### [Day-6](/Day-6/)
Linked list reversal

### [Day-7](/Day-7/)
Stack Operations
