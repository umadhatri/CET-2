## Stack 101
1. Stack is a linear data structure where elements are inserted and deleted only from one side called the 'top'.
2. Stack follows the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out).

## Operations on Stack
1. **Push** : The insertion of element into a stack
2. **Pop** : The deletion of an element from stack
3. **Top** : The last element of stack is kept track of using the 'top' pointer.
