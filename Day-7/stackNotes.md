# Stack Notes
This is for the notes of Day - 7 (27.02.2024)

## Stack 101
1. Stack is a linear data structure where elements are inserted and deleted only from one side called the 'top'.
2. Stack follows the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out).

## Operations on Stack
1. **Push** : The insertion of element into a stack
2. **Pop** : The deletion of an element from stack
3. **Top** : The last element of stack is kept track of using the 'top' pointer. 

## Applications of Stack
1. Function calls and recursion
2. Undo/Redo operations
3. Expression evaluation
4. Browser history

## Stack implementation
1. A stack is empty if the top value is '-1' (if implemeted using arrays)
2. If an element is added, increment the top.
